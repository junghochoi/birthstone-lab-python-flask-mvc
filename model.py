    "A": """People with A blood type are sensitive, cooperative, emotional, passionate and clever. 
    They are very patient, loyal and love peace and thus do not like to get into a fight with anyone. 
    But sometimes these people become overly sensitive. They do not like to break the rules set down by society and care about etiquette and social standards.
    These people take their time to make decisions and are too organized in all spheres of life but cannot multitask. They like things neat and clean and at the right place, which is why many people with OCD fall into A blood type.
    People with this blood type also get stressed easily and thus have a high level of cortisol (stress) hormone.""",

    "AB": """People with AB blood type are a mix of A and B personality types, just like their blood group. 
    These people are complicated and can have dual personalities like they can be shy like 
    A type as well as outgoing like B type. They try to keep their true personalities from strangers,
    thereby making most believe that they are a mixed personality. It is hard to decode these 
    people until you know them thoroughly. Also, these people are the rarest blood type in the world.
    They are charming and make friends easily. There will never be a dull moment 
    in a group of friends even if only one of them is AB blood type. They are poor at handling stress.
    AB people are very careful while dealing with others and are empathetic.""",

    "O": """People with O blood type are daring, outgoing and go-getters. 
    They have a habit of setting high standard for themselves and do all they can to achieve them. 
    These people have excellent leadership qualities and little things do not bother them, 
    which makes them appear as selfish to other people, especially to A type.
    They are generous, kind-hearted and loving. They adapt well with changes. 
    They are resilient and flexible and can do better than other blood types in tough situations.
    Positive personalities traits: Leadership, easy going, positive outlook, 
    confident, calm, outgoing, cautious, loyal, peaceful, passionate, independent, reliable, carefree, trendsetter and devoted""",

    "B": """These people are very creative and quick decision makers. 
    But they are not good at taking orders. They put every part of themselves into something they want to focus on.
    They have a very strong desire and drive to be the best of everything they do. But just like the A blood type, these people are also not good at multi-tasking.
    People with B blood type are thoughtful and empathetic towards others and make good and reliable friends. 
    These people also face a lot of discrimination because of their negative personality traits such as
    selfishness and being uncooperative at times. The society also focuses on the negative side of the 
    people with B blood type, even though they have a good side too. But as a result of this, they tend to be loners."""
